# Introduction
This is a project of a web application that simulates a customer support scenario. The scenario is: the customer
needs help and they submit their number to later receive a call from the customer service.

# Installation
I recommend installing the application using `Ansible`.

## Ansible
The application is set up to be installed via an `Ansible` playbook in the [`ansible` directory](./ansible/). Read
the [`README`](./ansible/README.md) for more information.
