These classes are pointless...

All the sources are available online, we are not being graded for knowing
the stuff presented during the classes, they are presented in the form
of a lecture, which is the worst form of teaching (I will remember
10% at most after the class).

The only thing we are graded for are the tasks given during classes, a presentation
and the project. I foresee a scenario in which tasks are too long to complete
during classes, so everyone will finish them at home anway.

So I assume what will happen is:
* people will ignore what is being said and be bored for an hour
* start the task
* finish the task at home

So student engagement is actally like 30% of all the classes.
Why are they obligatory then?

It's another questionable design for the classes.
